# Style
  # why is style important?
  # choosing good variable names
  # comments
  # indentation, lining things up

# Dataset is huge, with many columns. 
# We need to get a handle on what we have. 



# going through every variable can get tedious. 
# Luckily we have a computer!
# use a for loop. Basic syntax:



# try this out on our columns

# looping vector can be any vector


# Conditional statements - if/else
# basic syntax:

# equivalent syntax, since only 1 command inside { }

# if ... else



# if ... else if ... else if ... else


# Usually, you will evaluate something inside of if(   )



# Style:
#   Pick good variable names - short but informative and accurate
#   include comments - enough to describe program, but not too much
#   line things up, indent inside if's and for's

# indentation example: if, else if, else


# Comments - give useful information


# Is your code easy to read? White space can help. Don't go overboard
# if a line is too long, consider defining intermediate variables if
# speed is not an issue
