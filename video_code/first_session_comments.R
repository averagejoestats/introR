# How to watch and learn
# - get 2 screens if you can
# - open the <filename>_comments.R version in RStudio
# - type in the commands yourself as you go
# - hit pause and experiment beyond what we do here
# - Read the help files. Yes, really read them.
# - It will feel slow and tedious at first  --->  faster path to mastery


## Part 1:

# Install R
# Install RStudio
# Organize your files!
# Rstudio layout
# RStudio options
# - disable workspace saving and storing
# - code on left, console on right










## Part 2:

# this is a comment


# understand your working directory - global vs local or relative paths


# read in a dataset (titanic data)
# source: https://hbiostat.org/data/


# csv and data.frame store a table of data
# each row is an "observation" (one person)
# each column is a "variable" (name, sex, etc.)
# columns may have different types (character string, number, date)

# get information about the dataset

# why did ticket get coded as character?
# what about commas in Name?


# access a column


# basic statistics


# basic math operations


# math operations on vectors


# getting help


# what happened with 'x' and 'digits'?


# you can also type commands directly in the console
# same as running them from the script


# create your own vectors


# improve our plot of Survived vs Age by adding uniform noise
# to each variable


# save your data frame as a csv


# saving your data frame as an RData object
