# Add your code to complete the tasks outlined in each set of comments.
# You should use code and variables whenever possible, instead
# of hard-coding numbers into your script.


# Create a folder on your computer for storing files for this
# course. You should have different subfolders (subdirectories)
# for different types of files (e.g. datasets, homework)
# (no code needed for this part)

# Set your working directory to the folder that contains this script.
# Then print out your working directory.

# Read in the file ames_housing.csv using relative paths. Assign it
# to a variable with an appropriate name.


# How many rows and columns are in the dataset?


# Print out the first six rows of the data.


# make a histogram of the Gr_Liv_Area variable (total square feet)
# The histogram should have 50 bars


# What are the different Bldg_Type's, and how many of each type
# are there? This should take 1 line of code.


# In what year was the oldest house built?


# How large is the largest building (by Gr_Liv_Area)


# Look up the documentation for the which.max function, and use it
# to print out all of the data for the largest building


# Make a scatter plot of the Sale_Price against Gr_Liv_Area


# Calculate the average sale price


# Calculate the median sale price


# Look at the documentation for the quantile function, and use it
# to calculate the 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 0.95 quantiles of Sale_Price,
# all in one line of code


# Calculate the *proportion* of lots that are slightly irregular
# without hard-coding the denominator of the proportion.


# Use the summary function to figure out if Gr_Liv_Area is always
# equal to First_Flr_SF + Second_Flr_SF


# Make a table counting all combinations of House_Style and the total 
# number of bathrooms (half baths count as 1/2 of a bathroom)
# make the table look as nice as possible


# Print out the first 10 rows of the ames data and only the following columns: 
# Bldg_Type, Year_Built, Gr_Liv_Area, Bedroom_AbvGr, Year_Sold, Sale_Price


# Save a csv file of the dataset but only for the columns listed above.
# Do not include row names
