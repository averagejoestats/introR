# read in the marathon data


# do a regression of time_minutes on vaporfly and sex


# give your interpretation of the results


# the previous analysis controlled for sex, in case the men
# were more (or less) likely to wear vaporflys than women were
# we should really control for runner, in case faster runners
# tend to wear vaporflys.
# Make a dataframe with 4 columns: 
# - name, 
# - sex, 
# - vapor_avg: average time in vaporfly shoes,
# - nonvapor_avg: average time in non-vaporfly shoes.
# There are different ways of doing this.
# You'll have to do some coding to create this dataset


# print out the rows for the men with the 10 fastest vapor_avg
# print out the rows for the women with the 10 fastest vapor_avg


# create a new column for the difference between each runner's
# vapor_avg and nonvapor_avg


# calculate the mean difference for men and for women


# print out the rows for the 10 runners with the largest difference.
# largest means: biggest improvement when switching to vaporflys


# how many men and how many women ran races in both types of shoes?


# make a plot of the differences as a function of each runner's
# nonvapor_avg. Differentiate the points for men and women.
# make sure your plot looks nice (axis labels, etc.)
